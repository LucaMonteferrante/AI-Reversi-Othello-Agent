# AI-Reversi-Othello-Agent

I made an AI Agent to play Reversi (otherwise known as Othello) for a AI competition. The rules stipulate that you must make a legal move within 2.0 seconds. If you don't, then it's the opponent's turn again. 

I have also included some other not-so great agents which came with the competition. My AI agent is student_agent.py
